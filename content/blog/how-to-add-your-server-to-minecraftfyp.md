# How to Add Your Server to MinecraftFYP

Want to get more players on your Minecraft server? Listing it on MinecraftFYP is completely free and only takes a few minutes. Here's how to do it.

## Step 1: Create an Account

First, you'll need to create a free account on MinecraftFYP.

1. Click the **Register** button in the top right corner
2. Register using any option

## Step 2: Add Your Server

Once you're logged in, it's time to add your server.

1. Navigate to your dashboard
2. Click **Add Server**
3. Fill out the server information form

### Server Information You'll Need

Have this information ready before you start:

- **Server Name** - The name players will see
- **Server Address** - Your IP address or domain (e.g., `play.yourserver.com` or `123.45.67.89`)
- **Description** - Tell players what makes your server special
- **Gamemode(s)** - Survival, Creative, Skyblock, Factions, etc.
- **Minecraft Version** - Which version(s) your server supports

### Optional but Recommended

- **Banner Image** - A custom banner makes your listing stand out
- **Discord Link** - Help players join your community
- **Website** - Link to your server's website if you have one

## Step 3: Submit and Go Live

Once you've filled out all the information:

1. Double-check everything looks correct
2. Simply submit your server
3. Your server will now appear on MinecraftFYP

We'll automatically check your server's status and display the current player count to visitors.

## Tips for a Successful Listing

- **Be honest** - Accurately describe your server and its features
- **Use a good banner** - First impressions matter
- **Keep it updated** - If your server changes, update your listing
- **Engage with votes** - Encourage your players to vote for your server

## It's Free, Forever
